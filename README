I'll only make test html5 code on this project.

something html5 like widget.

File API - support readAsText(),readAsDataURl(),readAsArrayBuffer(), this works Chrome & Firefox 12,not works any IE yet
File System & Writer API works only Chrome(not released yet)


Range Widget,this works only Chrome
color pick - not html5
----
I tested only Windows Chrome.if there are contributer I will support others.
but maybe official would support all platform.
